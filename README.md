# Nextcloud Installation Script
Easy automatic CLI-Installation of Nextcloud


This script features an automatic installation of Nextcloud via CLI.<br /><br />
The script will check if you've already installed a Nextcloud version and if it's the latest release-version (e.g. 11.0.2).<br />

You decide, how you want to install Nextcloud on your server. For example you can set the target directory, SMTP-Credentials,<br />
admin-Username and much more!

Database-Name, Database-password and Admin-password will be generated automatically - due to security reasons.

Now let the script do it's work. 

That's it! Once it's done, visit your website and enjoy Nextcloud!
